# Input: The first line contains an integer d (the distance between 2 cities). 
#        The second line contains an integer m (the maximum miles a car can travel on a full tank). 
#        The third line specifies an integer n (the number of gas stops between 2 cities). 
#        Finally, the last line contains integers stop_1, stop_2, ..., stop_n (distances along the way).
# Output: The minimum number of refills needed. 
#         We assume that the car starts with a full tank. 
#         If it is not possible to reach the destination, output âˆ’1.
