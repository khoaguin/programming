    "- Classes are first-class objects in Python, so a function can be used to create a new class at any time, without using the `class` keyword. \n",
    "- Class decorators are also functions, but designed to inspect, change, and even replace the decorated class with another class. \n",
    "- Finally, metaclasses are the most advanced tool for class metaprogramming: they let you create whole new categories of classes with special traits, such as the abstract base classes weâ€™ve already seen.\n",

    "Note: <span style=\"color:orange\">*Metaclasses are powerful, but hard to justify and even harder to get right. Class decorators solve many of the same problems and are easier to understand*</span>"
