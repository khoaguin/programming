    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Native coroutine***</span>: A coroutine function defined with `async def`. You can delegate from a native coroutine to another native coroutine using the `await` keyword, similar to how classic coroutines use `yield` from. The `async def` statement always defines a native coroutine, even if the await keyword is not used in its body. The `await` keyword cannot be used outside of a native coroutine\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Classic coroutine***</span>: A generator function that consumes data sent to it via `my_coro.send(data)` calls, and reads that data by using `yield` in an expression. Classic coroutines can delegate to other classic coroutines using `yield` from. Classic coroutines cannot be driven by `await`, and are no longer supported by `asyncio`.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Generator-based coroutine***</span>: A generator function decorated with `@types.coroutine` — introduced in Python 3.5. That decorator makes the generator compatible with the new `await` keyword.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Asynchronous generator***</span>: A generator function defined with `async def` and using `yield` in its body. It returns an asynchronous generator object that provides `__anext__`, a coroutine method to retrieve the next item."

    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">***Using the syntax `await loop.getaddrinfo(...)` avoids blocking because `await` suspends the current coroutine object. For example, during the execution of the `probe('if.dev')` coroutine, a new coroutine object is created by `getaddrinfo('if.dev', None)`. Awaiting it starts the low-level `addrinfo` query and yields control back to the event loop, not to the `probe(‘if.dev’)` coroutine, which is suspended. The event loop can then drive other pending coroutine objects, such as `probe('or.dev')`. When the event loop gets a response for the `getaddrinfo('if.dev', None)` query, that specific coroutine object resumes and returns control back to the `probe('if.dev')` — which was suspended at `await` — and can now handle a possible exception and return the result tuple.***</span>"
