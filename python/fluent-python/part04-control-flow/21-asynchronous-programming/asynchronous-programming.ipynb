    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Native coroutine***</span>: A coroutine function defined with `async def`. You can delegate from a native coroutine to another native coroutine using the `await` keyword, similar to how classic coroutines use `yield` from. The `async def` statement always defines a native coroutine, even if the await keyword is not used in its body. The `await` keyword cannot be used outside of a native coroutine\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Classic coroutine***</span>: A generator function that consumes data sent to it via `my_coro.send(data)` calls, and reads that data by using `yield` in an expression. Classic coroutines can delegate to other classic coroutines using `yield` from. Classic coroutines cannot be driven by `await`, and are no longer supported by `asyncio`.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Generator-based coroutine***</span>: A generator function decorated with `@types.coroutine` â€” introduced in Python 3.5. That decorator makes the generator compatible with the new `await` keyword.\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:skyblue\">***Asynchronous generator***</span>: A generator function defined with `async def` and using `yield` in its body. It returns an asynchronous generator object that provides `__anext__`, a coroutine method to retrieve the next item."
