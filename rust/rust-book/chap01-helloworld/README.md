Run the `.sh` files to create, build and run example Rust projects

## Useful Commands

> - Check Rust version with `rustc --version` and update with `rustup update`
> - Run a rust file with `rustc main.rs`
> - We can create a project using `cargo new`.
> - We can build a project using `cargo build`.
> - We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
> - We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
> - When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in *target/release* instead of *target/debug*. The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile.
> - To work on an existing Rust project, you probably just need to do `git clone <project>` then `cd project` and `cargo build`
