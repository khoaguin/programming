    "A pointer is a general concept for a variable that contains an address in memory. This address refers to, or “points at,” some other data.  <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">***The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a reference** (Chapter 4). References are indicated by the `&` symbol and borrow the value they point to. They don’t have any special capabilities other than referring to data, and have no overhead.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">*Smart pointers, on the other hand, are data structures that act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities (like in C++)*</span>. Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, has an additional difference between references and smart pointers: while references only borrow data, in many cases, smart pointers own the data they point to. *For example, `String` and `Vec<T>` are smart pointers because they own some memory and allow you to manipulate it. They also have metadata and extra capabilities or guarantees.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightgreen\">*Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs, but they specifically implements the `Deref` and `Drop` traits*</span>. The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so you can write your code to work with either references or smart pointers. The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that’s run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will cover the most common types of smart pointers:\n",
    "- `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap\n",
    "- `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership\n",
    "- `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time"

    "## Using `Box<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward smart pointer is a box, whose type is written `Box<T>`. <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">*`Box<T>` allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxes don’t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don’t have many extra capabilities either. You’ll use them most often in these situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size\n",
    "- When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so, so we store the large data on the heap in a box and only the small amount of pointer data is copied around on the stack, while the data it references stays in one place on the heap.\n",
    "- When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type\n"
