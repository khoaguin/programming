Subclasses shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their parent class but will do so with inheritance. This can make a program’s design less flexible. It also introduces the possibility of calling methods on subclasses that don’t make sense or that cause errors because the methods don’t apply to the subclass. In addition, some languages will only allow single inheritance (meaning a subclass can only inherit from one class), further restricting the flexibility of a program’s design.*</span>\n",

They could each override the dra`w` method to define their custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of the types as if they were `Component` instances and call `draw` on them.
