    "## The Anatomy of a Test Function\n",
    "At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the `test` attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is the `derive` attribute. <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">***To change a function into a test function, add `#[test]` on the line before `fn`***</span>. When you run your tests with the `cargo test` command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether each test function passes or fails.\n",
