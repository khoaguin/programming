Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is the `derive` attribute. <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">***To change a function into a test function, add `#[test]` on the line before `fn`***</span>. When you run your tests with the `cargo test` command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether each test function passes or fails.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:green\">***If our project is a binary crate that only contains a `src/main.rs` file and doesn’t have a `src/lib.rs` file, we can’t create integration tests in the tests directory and bring functions defined in the `src/main.rs` file into scope with a use statement. Only library crates expose functions that other crates can use; binary crates are meant to be run on their own.***</span>"
