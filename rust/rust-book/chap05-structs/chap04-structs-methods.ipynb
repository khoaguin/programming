If we had given `user2` new `String` values for both `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count` values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2` since `active` and `sign_in_count` are types that implement the `Copy` trait, so they are copied into `user2`.

    "> In the signature for area, we use `&self` instead of `rectangle: &Rectangle`. <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**The `&self` is actually short for `self: &Self`**</span>. Within an `impl` block, the type `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for. Methods must have a parameter named `self` of type `Self` for their first parameter, so Rust lets you abbreviate this with only the name `self` in the first parameter spot. Note that we still need to use the `&` in front of the self shorthand to indicate that this method borrows the `Self` instance, just as we did in `rectangle: &Rectangle`.   \n",
    "> <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">***Methods can take ownership of `self` (by using just `self` as the first parameter, but this is very rare), borrow `self` immutably, as we‚Äôve done here, or borrow `self` mutably, just as they can any other parameter.***</span>"

Calling methods is one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior. <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">***When you call a method with `object.something()`, Rust automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so object matches the signature of the method***</span>.

    "> The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a clear receiver‚Äîthe type of `self`. Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`). The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice."
