If we had given `user2` new `String` values for both `email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count` values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2` since `active` and `sign_in_count` are types that implement the `Copy` trait, so they are copied into `user2`.
