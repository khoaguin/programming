    "*A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time, e.g. even a single `.rs` file*. Crates can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections. The **crate root** is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.** \n",
    "> - <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Binary Crates**</span>: Programs with `main` and you can compile to an executable, such as a command-line program or a server and `src/main.rs` is the crate root \n",
    "> - <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">**Library Crates**</span>: Don’t have a `main` function, and they don’t compile to an executable with `src/lib.rs` as the crate root. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects, e.g. the `rand` crate\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:skyblue\">*A **package** is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality. A package contains a `Cargo.toml` file that describes how to build those crates*</span>. For example, `Cargo` is actually a package that contains the binary crate for the command-line tool we have been using to build our code. If a package contains `src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs`, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the `src/bin` directory: each file will be a separate binary crate."

    "## Modules Cheat Sheet\n",
    "Say we have a `backyard` project with the following structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "backyard\n",
    "├── Cargo.lock\n",
    "├── Cargo.toml\n",
    "└── src\n",
    "    ├── garden\n",
    "    │   └── vegetables.rs\n",
    "    ├── garden.rs\n",
    "    └── main.rs\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. **Start from the crate root**: When compiling a crate, the compiler first looks in the crate root file (usually `src/lib.rs` for a library crate or `src/main.rs` for a binary crate) for code to compile. <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">*`src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs` are called crate roots because the contents of either of these two files form a module named crate at the root of the crate’s module structure, known as the **module tree**.*</span>\n",
    "2. **Declaring modules**: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules; say, you declare a “garden” module with `mod garden`;. The compiler will look for the module’s code in these places:\n",
    "    - Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following `mod garden`\n",
    "    - In the file `src/garden.rs`\n",
    "    - In the file `src/garden/mod.rs`\n",
    "3. **Declaring submodules**: In any file other than the crate root, you can declare submodules. For example, you might declare `mod vegetables`; in `src/garden.rs`. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the directory named for the parent module in these places:\n",
    "    - Inline, directly following `mod vegetables`, within curly brackets instead of the semicolon\n",
    "    - In the file `src/garden/vegetables.rs`\n",
    "    - In the file `src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs`\n",
    "4. **Paths to code in modules**: Once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an Asparagus type in the garden vegetables module would be found at `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`.\n",
    "5. **Private vs public**: Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with `pub mod` instead of `mod`. To make items within a public module public as well, use `pub` before their declarations.\n",
    "6. **The `use` keyword**: Within a scope, the `use` keyword creates shortcuts to items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`, you can create a shortcut with use `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`; and from then on you only need to write `Asparagus` to make use of that type in the scope.\n",
